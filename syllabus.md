## Academic Honesty

If you use code from another source (a website, a book, or another student) you
must cite it with a comment.  If you do not cite it, you will receive zero
credit for that assignment.  You should never copy another student's code
directly.  You may ask for advice or single-line snippets but if I find that
significant portions of your assignment have been copy pasted (trust me,
renaming the variables does not hide it) from another student, you will receive
a zero.
