# Class Overview

## My Introduction

My name is Cory Nezin, you can call me Cory, Mr. Nezin, or Professor Nezin,
whatever you are comfortable with.  I graduated from The Cooper Union with a
bachelors and masters degree in electrical engineering.  Since then, I've been
working at Bloomberg LP on machine learning infrastructure and information
extraction.  This is my first time teaching a class for credit so expect
some things to be rough around the edges.

## Your Introduction

State your name, major, prior programming experience, and what you want to get
out of this class.

## Assignments

Almost every lesson will be supplemented with an assignment.  Each assignment
will either be assigned individually or in small groups.  Assignments make
up a very large portion of you grade so make sure you put in the effort.
All assignments must be handed in one week after they are assigned **before**
the start of class.  This is my policy because I know how many students will
work on the assignment during class otherwise.

After receiving a grade on an assignment, you will be allowed to make revisions
for 1 week afterward for full credit.  This policy is a reflection of the fact
that no code is perfect on the first try.  You can submit any assignment for
early feedback at any time, and some assignments will have automated tests
that can tell you instantly whether your code produces an expected output.
The grading breakdown for an assignment is as follows:

Correctness: 75%
Style: 25%

What I mean by correctness should be obvious: inputs produce expected
outputs.  Style is slightly more subjective.  Mainly it means your code
is easily readable and well organized.  We will discuss specific expectations
later.

## Quizzes

Quizzes will be used as a way for me to gauge the understanding of the class,
so it is important that everyone try their best.  It is not my way of punishing
you for not understanding.  Most quizzes will be a single multiple choice
questions filled out electronically.

## Attendance

Attendance is not mandatory, but I highly suggest it.  If you don't want to
attend classes, you may be better off watching videos and reading tutorials
online rather than taking this class.  I'm not kidding!  That is still a really
good way to learn computer science.  There are people way more qualified and
engaging than me online, that you can watch for free.  Some great online
lectures include *CS50* from Stanford and *The Missing Semester* from MIT.

The benefits you get from actually attending class are:

* live interaction with your peer group, a shared experience.
* personalized teaching; and
* motivation to actually pay attention and learn.

I will still expect you take the quizzes however, regardless of if you attend
the lecture or not.  You may still complete them if you are not here, as long
as you complete them in the allotted time.  I realize some people may not
be able to attend class due to time zone differences.  If this is the case
for you, please message me and we will discuss some solutions.

Whatever you decide, all lectures will be recorded and freely available.

If you are attending, I prefer if you keep your camera on so I can get visual
feedback on your understanding of the material.

## Conduct

Please respect other students' privacy, and do not post any videos from this
class anywhere online.  You can post memes making fun of me on MLIC, but do
not disparage other students.

## Office Hours

I will hold office hours at least twice a week:

1. Right after class.
2. Another time to be voted upon.

Office hours a great time to ask in-depth questions that couldn't normally
be asked in class due to time constraints.  This includes help with
assignments and help fixing your programs.

I am also available for personal appointments outside of business hours, just
message me to set one up.

## Academic Honesty

You can use look up basic snippets of code online, but it is never appropriate
to copy code verbatim without understanding it.  If you copy entire assignments
or sizable chunks from the internet or classmates, that is cheating.  You can
certainly ask for advice, however.  If you do end up copying a small amount
of code from an online source, I ask that you type it out manually and think
about what you are writing rather than just copy pasting the whole thing.

If I find you are cheating on an assignment you will receive zero credit.  If
you cheat twice, that is an instant class failure.

## Topics

This course is not designed to give you a particularly deep introduction into
any field of computer science, but a broad overview of many parts.  We begin
with a very "low level" language, C which will help you understand some of the
inner workings of a computer.  We will then briefly touch on C++ to give you an
introduction to "object oriented programming".  Then we will move onto Python,
a high level language that you can use for fast prototyping.  We will then
spend some time with SQL (Structured Query Language) which is the de-facto
language for interfacing with databases.  Finally we will spend some time on
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  These are the languages of the web which we will
use to build some simple websites.  In summary:

0. Unix, Shell (1 week)
1. Git, GitHub (1 week)
2. C (4 weeks)
3. C++ (1 week)
4. Python (4 weeks)
5. SQL (1 week)
6. HTML, CSS, JavaScript (2 weeks)
7. TBD (2 weeks)

Again this is my first time running this class, so we may not end up having
enough time to cover all of this.  We may end up spending more time on C,
for example, if the class as a whole needs it.

If you want to delve into these subjects in a deeper way, we offer these
courses through the Electrical Engineering department:

* Hardware: Electronics, Digital Logic Design, Computer Architecture
* Sensors: Digital Signal Processing, Control Theory
* Networking: Computer Networking, Communication Theory
* Low level programming: Operating Systems, Compilers, Computer Security
* Advanced Algorithms: Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning
* Databases, SQL: Databases
* Web Development: Large Software Projects

If any of these things interest you, speak to me, or some member of the
Electrical Engineering faculty as soon as possible and we can help you
figure out if the classes are right for you and what requisites you may
need.

## Strategies for Learning

The same as any other skill, the best way to learn coding is to do it.  If you
simply write code frequently with the intention of making something interesting
or useful, you will learn to code.  Whenever you write code, you should always
be thinking of how to make it better.  For many problems you encounter, you
should always feel comfortable searching for the solution on the internet.
One very valuable thing to learn is how to search for the solution, and how
to describe the problem in a way that is can be easily searched.  We will work
on building coding vocabulary throughout the class.

## Questions

I will be asking all of you for a steady stream of feedback to make sure that
my teaching is working for you.  I come from a place of a decent amount of
experience, so it can be difficult for me to realize when something is not
obvious, or that some students might be lacking some requisite knowledge.

If you find something confusing, please call me out immediately as it is
likely that other students feel the same.  This class is for beginners, not
people who already have programming experience.  Therefore, no question
you could posssibly ask is to basic for me to answer.  If you have any
question during class just raise your hand.  If you are to shy for that,
feel free to message me privately and I will raise the question to the class
anonymously.

If you have questions outside of contact hours send the question in the Teams
chat for the proper subject.  You can send it in:

* The **General** chat for questions about the class itself
* The lesson specific chat for questions on the lesson or corresponding
assignment
* The **Basic Questions** chat for questions regarding basic computer science
questions not covered directly in class; or
* The **Advanced Questions** chat for questions regarding advanced computer
science and programming questions.

You can message me directly for any question as well.  The purpose of these
chats and their distinction is solely for other students to easily filter what
they see.

## Computers

> Can anyone tell me how computers work?

> Who can give an example of a program?
