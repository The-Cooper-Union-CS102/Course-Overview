## Grading

* Homework Assignments 70%
* Quizzes 10%
* Final Project 20%

The logic behind the grading is this:

Quizzes will be used as a way for me to gauge the understanding of the class,
so it is important that everyone try their best.  It is not my way of punishing
you for not understanding.  Homework assignments are weighted very heavily
because good coding happens when you have a long uninterrupted time period to
focus and check references, you should focus on honing this skill.  The goal
of the final project is to give you a chance to use coding creatively, on a
project you are interested in.

Homework assignments teach you to play chords, the final project teaches you to
compose.

## Academic Honesty

If you use code from another source (a website, a book, or another student) you
must cite it with a comment.  If you do not cite it, you will receive zero
credit for that assignment.  You should never copy another student's code
directly.  You may ask for advice or single-line snippets but if I find that
significant portions of your assignment have been copy pasted (trust me,
renaming the variables does not hide it) from another student, you will receive
a zero.
